utputs 2 - Parameter tuning outputs relating to the 28/07 resubmission. Shows the tuning of DT, RF algorithims. Parameter grid/result pairs. Occasional output from tester.py

Outputs - Original parameter tuning process.

Project Writeup - Updated for 28/07 resubmission. I've marked out a big section that still has my answers but has been partially superseded.

References - self explanatory

Udacity Project 5 Introduction to Machine Learning - Full Python Notebook file.  Again several bits of this are superseded, I left them in so that there is a record of the whole process. 

Testing Notebook - This is where i drafted the code for the 28/07 resubmission

poi_id.py - I have removed a lot of the superfluous code (still in the notebook however)
