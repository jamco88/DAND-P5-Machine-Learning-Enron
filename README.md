# Enron Machine Learning

PLACEHOLDER - TO BE UPDATED

My first end to end machine learning project. Featuring Data Processing Pipelines, Hyperparameter Grid Search, and more!

## Environment Setup

placeholder - note to self do pip freeze > requirements.txt

```bash
placeholder
```

## Usage

The notebook can be run by opening a shell, activating the anaconda environment, followed by:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
You can then run the notebooks.

Feel free to play around with the notebook and explore the effects of different hyperparameters.

The notebook is intended to be self explanatory.

##Old readme

Outputs 2 - Parameter tuning outputs relating to the 28/07 resubmission. Shows the tuning of DT, RF algorithims. Parameter grid/result pairs. Occasional output from tester.py

Outputs - Original parameter tuning process.

Project Writeup - Updated for 28/07 resubmission. I've marked out a big section that still has my answers but has been partially superseded.

References - self explanatory

Udacity Project 5 Introduction to Machine Learning - Full Python Notebook file.  Again several bits of this are superseded, I left them in so that there is a record of the whole process. 

Testing Notebook - This is where i drafted the code for the 28/07 resubmission

poi_id.py - I have removed a lot of the superfluous code (still in the notebook however)
